# Welcome to Areca

This is a small demo of the Areca toolkit. It is meant to showcase the **UI** and give a brief overview of the **programming**. You can <a href="#flip">flip</a> the page at any time to switch between general description and some code snippets.

## What is Areca?

When I started to make apps for mobile devices I first looked into Android I found that building apps with Gradle is unbelievable slow. Really not fun to work with. Second bummer for me was that Android development is tight to IntelliJ, which I don't like. And, most important: it is just one platform. No desktop, no iOS.

Areca is a toolkit build on top of the great [TeaVM](http://teavm.org).

- For mobile and desktop
- Easy API
- Just **100% Java** (or Kotlin, Groovy, Scala, ...)
- No HTML, XML, JavaScript
